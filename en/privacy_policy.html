  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Random Nutrition Privacy Policy. This policy explains how we, Killian Cengo ("we," "our," "us"), collect, use, and protect the information you ("user," "you," "your") provide or that is generated when you use our mobile application "Random Nutrition" (the "App"). Your privacy is a priority for us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data collection and management practices.

    We collect two main categories of information when you use the Random Nutrition App:
  </p>
  <p><strong>User-Provided Data:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The foods you record in the App.</li>
    <li>Macronutrient information (e.g., protein, carbohydrates, fat) that you provide to customize your meals or track your eating habits.</li>
    <li>This data is collected to improve the App and is sent to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Usage statistics: For example, which features you use the most or how frequently you use the App.</li>
    <li>Device information: Device type, operating system (iOS, Android, etc.), and unique identifiers (such as the device ID).</li>

    <li>This data is collected to improve the App and to fix technical issues.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>How We Collect Information</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>User-Provided Data:</strong> You enter this information directly through the App interface, for example by adding foods or entering macronutrient data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> We use technologies such as software development kits (SDKs) for analytics and crash reporting to collect this information in the background while you use the App.
  </p>
  
  <h3>How We Use the Information</h3>
  <p>
    We use the information collected for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To provide and personalize the App:</strong> For example, generating balanced meals based on the data you provide.</li>
    <li><strong>To improve the App:</strong> Analyzing usage statistics to identify which features to optimize or bugs to fix.</li>
    <li><strong>To develop new features:</strong> Using the data to design enhancements or new services tailored to your needs.</li>
    <li><strong>To diagnose technical problems:</strong> Using crash reports and performance data to ensure a smooth and stable user experience.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>User-Provided Data:</strong> This data (recorded foods and macronutrient information) is not shared with third parties and is only transmitted to our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> We collect this data on our servers exclusively for analysis purposes. It is not shared with third parties.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Data Security</h3>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. This includes the use of standard security technologies and limiting access to data only to those who need it to provide our services. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>
  
  <h3>User Rights</h3>
